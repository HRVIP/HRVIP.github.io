# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Testing

It's important to test locally when you make a change or update the website. This is most easily done by running `jekyll serve` in the directory and checking that the changes show up how you imagined they should.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/HRVIP/HRVIP.github.io/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
John Karasinski
