      The purpose of the UC Davis Center for Human/Robotics/Vehicle Integration and Performance (HRVIP Lab) is to conduct broadly interdisciplinary research to keep humans alive in extreme and highly hazardous environments, such as spaceflight, aircraft emergencies, and robotic surgery.
      <br>
      <br> Our approach is to enhance traditional design capabilities for human-involved engineering systems by incorporating knowledge of human understanding (cognitive psychology) and human brain function (neuroscience). The result is an intensively cross-disciplinary research center at UC Davis that develops fundamental knowledge, technical innovation, and validated simulations to enhance human performance in highly-hazardous environments, with significant improvements in safety â€“ in other words, to keep people alive where both the risk and rewards are very high.
