<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>Andrew Neish is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at Stanford University working on solutions to security vulnerabilities in civil GPS with an emphasis on spoof detection and mitigation. His research contains two areas of focus: cryptographic methods to ensure integrity of WAAS/GPS data, and methods of inertial navigation system (INS) - GPS fusion using low cost commercial off the shelf (COTS) sensors for spoof detection. He completed his Master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2017 at Stanford and his Bachelor's in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC Davis in 2014.</p>
