<p>I am currently a fourth year Aerospace and Mechanical Engineer (B.S.) at UC Davis. I am working on the acoustic boundary layer separation sensing and intelligent vortex generator. Along with this I am a part of Aerobrick and SpaceED Rockets. My research interest are in computational fluid dynamics, propulsion systems, reentry vehicles, and aerothermodynamics. </p>
