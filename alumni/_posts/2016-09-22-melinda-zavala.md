<p>Melinda is a recent graduate of UC Davis' Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering program. Currently, she is performing research at NASA Ames' Human Factors and System Integration Division, aiding in the development of a visual display system for low-altitude flight in low-visibility conditions for helicopter pilots alongside the US and Israeli Armies. Earlier at Ames, she worked on an experiment, and now published paper, pursuing the solution for optimizing motion cueing in flight simulators for maximized transfer of manual control skills required for full stall recovery in an aircraft. She is currently looking to pursue her masters in an aerospace-related field.</p>
