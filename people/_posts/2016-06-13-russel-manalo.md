<p>I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student studying Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering.  My current research includes working on boundary layer separation sensing along with intelligent vortex generators.  Prior to joining the HRVIP Lab, I conducted research in Professor White's Atmospheric Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel.  My research interests include propulsion system, fluid mechanics, and aircraft dynamics.</p>
