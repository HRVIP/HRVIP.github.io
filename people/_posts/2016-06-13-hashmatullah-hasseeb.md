<p>I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at UC Davis. Currently, I am modeling and testing aircraft in X-plane. In addition, I am performing reentry analysis on an X-37 reconfigured to transport astronauts from the ISS during medical emergencies. My research interests are in satellites and reentry.</p>
