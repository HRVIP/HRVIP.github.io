<p>B.S. and M.S. in MAE from Utah State University, 2007</p>
<p>During studies at Utah State, I was a researcher assistant in the MAE department and had a couple summer internships at NASA Ames.. My Master's thesis was on moving mesh computational fluid dynamics simulations. After graduating I went to work as a contractor at NASA Ames and am now at Johnson Space Center working mainly with computational fluid dynamics, but also involved in designing and running wind tunnel tests and populating aerodynamic databases. Projects have been Ares I and V, Orion, Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, WB-57, supersonic retropropulsion, CST-100, and Dream Chaser.</p>
<p>Research interest is in aircraft wake vortices. I am working to stand up the capability to simulate wake vortex generation, propagation, and decay using Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes methods. With the capability it is hoped to conduct detailed and cost-effective parametric studies on wake vortex dispersion behavior, then validate existing or write a new simple math model for the vortex behavior. The simple math model will be used for onboard calculation of surrounding vortices which can be visualized in the cockpit. The goal is to increase flight crew situational awareness, airspace safety, and airport capacity.</p>
