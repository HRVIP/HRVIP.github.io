<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. Mechanical Engineering, California State University Northridge, 2013<br/>
B.S. Computer Science, California State University Northridge, 2008</p>
<p>Etan received a bachelor's degree in computer science from California State University, Northridge (CSUN) in 2008. Prior to graduating he began working as a software engineer at a small company based out of Los Angeles. Following graduation Etan began taking flying lessons out of Van Nuys Airport in San Fernando Valley and, after logging just over 50 hours, earned his private pilot license in the Spring of 2009. In Spring 2011 he returned to CSUN as a postgraduate student in mechanical engineering and received his second bachelor's degree with emphasis in aerospace engineering two years later. After backpacking across Europe from Norway to Greece over the course of 5 weeks in the Summer of 2013 Etan moved from Northridge to Davis, California, to attend UC Davis as a master's student in aerospace engineering.</p>
<p>Etan's research interests at UC Davis include spacecraft and spaceplane design, guidance, navigation, and control. More specifically, he will be continuing the ongoing work to investigate modifying an X-37B for use as a \xe2\x80\x98space ambulance' with the goal of returning an injured astronaut on mission in orbit to Earth as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
