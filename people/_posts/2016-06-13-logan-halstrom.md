<h2 class="team-title">Logan Halstrom</h2>
<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, UC Davis, 2013<br/>
B.S. in Aerospace Science and Engineering, UC Davis, 2013</p>
<p>Logan is a PhD Candidate in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with a research emphasis on applications of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to unsteady, turbulent, massively-separated flows. Logan’s thesis focuses on CFD simulation of the unstable pendulum motion of NASA’s Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle’s main parachutes. The model will be validated by comparison to empirical data and will be utilized to more fundamentally understand and mitigate parachute dynamic instability.<br/><br/>
As an undergraduate transfer student at UC Davis, Logan was captain of the Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team, which placed 2nd internationally in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aero Design competition. During Logan’s graduate studies at UC Davis, he has also been a returning intern at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, starting at the Aircraft Operations Division, where he designed and conducted a pitot-static calibration flight test for the WB-57 aircraft.<br/><br/>
Logan is currently a NASA Pathways Intern at JSC’s Applied Aeroscience and CFD Branch, where his work focuses on dynamic CFD applications such as moving mesh simulations of the Orion spacecraft parachute. Logan is also working to optimize the performance of the Orion Flush Air Data System (FADS), which provides crucial information about the vehicle’s atmospheric descent. Optimal sensor configuration accuracy is determined using a Genetic Algorithm and a novel design metric based on simulated instrument error robustness.</p>
