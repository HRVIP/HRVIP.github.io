<h2 class="team-title">Logan Halstrom</h2>
<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, UC Davis, 2013<br/>
B.S. in Aerospace Science and Engineering, UC Davis, 2013</p>
<p>Logan is a PhD student in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering with a research emphasis on applications of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to turbulent flows.  Logan’s current research focuses on the safety of the Orion atmospheric descent system and includes CFD modeling of the Orion parachute system and validation of the simulation by comparison to empirical results as well as the optimization of the capsule’s air data system.<br/><br/>
As an undergraduate transfer student at UC Davis, Logan was captain of the Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team, which placed 2nd internationally in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aero Design competition.  During Logan’s graduate studies at UC Davis, he has also been a returning intern at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, starting at the Aircraft Operations Division, where he designed and conducted a pitot-static calibration flight test for the WB-57 aircraft.  Logan is currently a NASA Pathways Intern at JSC’s Applied Aeroscience and CFD Branch, where his work focuses on dynamic CFD applications such as moving mesh simulations of the Orion spacecraft parachute descent system and the dynamic instabilities that result during to off-design failure modes.  Logan is also working to optimize the performance of the Orion Flush Air Data System (FADS), which provides crucial information about the vehicle’s atmospheric descent.  Sensor placement optimization is accomplished using a Genetic Algorithm and CFD simulation of various descent heatshield pressure environments.</p>
