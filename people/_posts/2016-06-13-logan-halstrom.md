<p>Logan is a PhD student in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering with a research emphasis on applications of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to turbulent flows. Logan received B.S. degrees in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering from UC Davis in 2013. As an undergraduate, Logan was captain of the Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team which placed 2nd internationally in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Aero Design competition. Before starting graduate studies at UC Davis, Logan interned at NASA Johnson Space Center's Aircraft Operations Division where he designed and conducted a pitot-static flight test for the WB-57 aircraft.  He returned to NASA JSC the following summer to join the Applied Aerosciences and CFD Branch to perform prescribed pendulum motion CFD simulations of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) to further understand and mitigate the dynamic instability of the Orion decent system during off-design failure modes.  Logan's current research focus is on CFD modeling of the Orion parachute system and validation of the simulation by comparison to empirical results.</p>
