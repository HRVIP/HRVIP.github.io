<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 2012</p>
<p>Carey is a master's student in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering focusing on human factors in spaceflight, specifically space suit design. Carey received his B.S. in aeronautical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, NY. As an undergraduate, Carey worked at the Center for Flow, Physics, and Control on advanced flow control. Between RPI and UC Davis, Carey was an intern at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center working on finite element modeling of composite materials for the James Webb Space Telescope and at NASA Johnson Space Center in the Advanced Space Suit Development Team. Currently, Carey investigates advanced space suit glove designs to improve mobility and reduce fatigue during extravehicular activities (EVA) and training. This research will be used to formulate a PhD. project to be completed post master's degree. </p>
