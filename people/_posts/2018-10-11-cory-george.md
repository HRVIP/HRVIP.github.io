<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>Cory is a 4th year double major in Aerospace Science and Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.  He serves as an officer of the Space and Satellites Systems student organization and is currently designing an Attitude Determination and Control System for UC Davis' first undergraduate built satellite. Cory is a NASA intern "repeat offender" spending time at both Stennis Space Center and Johnson Space Center. Most recently he worked on a database classifying root cause of equipment failure for much of the Environmental Control and Life Support Systems aboard the International Space Station. This work is meant to inform logistics and design for future deep space missions where re-supply is not possible.</p>
<p>When Cory finds a sliver of free time he is most likely playing his guitar, writing and recording music, skiing, or hiking around the Sierras.</p>
