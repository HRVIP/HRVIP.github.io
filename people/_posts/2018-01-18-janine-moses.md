B.S. Mechanical Engineering, UC Davis, 2019</p>
<p>Janine is currently designing an externally mounted head-up display (HUD) for eventual use on spacesuit helmets. She used this external HUD as proof of concept for the NASA REVEALS Project (Radiation Effects on Volatiles and Exploration of Asteroids and Lunar Surfaces), with the goal of developing a HUD to display radiation exposure data to astronauts during EVAs and surface operations. Janine will also spend time at Johnson Space Center, integrating the external HUD with current spacesuits used in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab to display biometric data to astronauts during training.</p>
<p>During her undergraduate years, Janine was a co-op at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in the cable harness engineering group working on the Europa Clipper spacecraft. Janine also interned for two summers at The Aerospace Corporation, one summer in the Space Materials Lab and another summer with a team that supported Boeing's WGS-10 military satellite. During undergrad, Janine was a member of Eclipse Rocketry where she helped launch high powered model rockets and payloads for the NASA University Student Launch Initiative. She is also a private pilot and loves spending time in the outdoors!</p>
