<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, UC Davis, 2020</p>

<p>Abhay found his passion for space science and engineering when he joined Space and Satellite Systems. He is fascinated by how things work and how to make things work (including talking in the third person). And through curiosity and perseverance, he's becoming an Aerospace Engineer.</p>

<p>Abhay received his B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC Davis in June 2020 and is now working towards his M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. He has three years of experience developing UC Davis' first undergraduate-built CubeSat as a member of Space and Satellite Systems and has co-led the development of the low-cost attitude determination and control system. He has interned as a fluids test engineer at NASA's Kennedy Space Center over the summer of 2019 for the Restore-L mission. And he has interned as an aerospace engineer working on orbital trajectory optimization at Momentus over the summer of 2020.</p>

<p>Abhay enjoys biking, basketball, chocolate, playing board games with friends, watching movies, and meeting new people.</p>
