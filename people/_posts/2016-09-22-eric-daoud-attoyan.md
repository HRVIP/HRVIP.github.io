<p>Master\xe2\x80\x99s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, ECAM Lyon, France, Graduation in 2015</p>
<p>Currently a graduate student in mechanical engineering in ECAM Lyon, France. I interned at UC Davis from September 2014 to January 2015 in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. The main assignment of this internship was working with the AMAT Team, but I was also affiliated with the HRVIP Lab on several projects.</p>
<p>This is my first experience in Aerospace engineering, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking fluid mechanics classes which helps understanding the basics of aerodynamics. Studying at UC Davis and working with HRVIP is a great way to become competent in this field, learning many useful knowledges and skills that will be useful for my future career.</p>
