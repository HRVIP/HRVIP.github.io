<h2 class="team-title">Zane Hays</h2>
<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>Zane is senior at UC Davis majoring in Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. He is planning on attending graduate school in Fall of 2019 for aerospace engineering. He is currently working with NASA Ames on a re-entry project called Pterodactyl. Zaneâ€™s focus for the Pterodactyl project has mainly been high speed re-entry aerodynamics. His research interests extend to space travel, orbital mechanics, and everything related to space. In particular, long distance human exploration; both the human, biomedical, side and the propulsive sides required to achieve true human space exploration. He is also involved in designing and building RC airplanes for students through the Advanced Modeling Aeronautics Team. Apart from engineering, Zane enjoys rock climbing, hiking, backpacking, martial arts, dance, and board games.</p>
