<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Engineering Physics, Stanford University, 2015</p>
<p>At UC Davis, Molly is pursuing her M.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Her HRVIP research focuses on computer vision for semi-autonomous satellite navigation.</p>
<p>Molly graduated from Stanford University in Engineering Physics, with a concentration in computational science. Her undergraduate research focused on CCD characterization for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Outside of research, she spent a year as president of the Engineering Physics Interdisciplinary Community, and she was greatly involved in leadership for Stanford Outdoor Education, particularly for pre-orientation wilderness trips for incoming freshmen. Molly’s interests are many and varied, and she has had internships at SLAC, the Yosemite Museum, and the NASA Ames Coded Structures Lab.</p>
<p>Molly’s primary academic interests are in optics, sensors, space exploration, and the history of science, although she has never been known to turn away from an interesting engineering problem. In her spare time, she enjoys singing, social dance, building telescopes, and running around in the wilderness.</p>
