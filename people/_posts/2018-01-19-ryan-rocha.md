<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, UC Davis, 2017</p>
<p>Ryan is currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Mechanical and Aerospace engineering at UC Davis. His research interests pertain to UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) control related technologies. Courses in control systems and mechatronics during his undergraduate career were the driving factor behind his decision to pursue a graduate degree in the field.</p>
<p>His previous work experiences have been in the fields of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Heating, Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC). He spent three summers at NASA Ames Research Center generating overset structured grids for the Space Launch System (SLS) for use in CFD simulations as well as assisting in the improvement of CFD data organization and visualization techniques. His experience in the HVAC industry ranges from constructing building consumption simulations to designing custom evaporative pre-coolers for packaged air conditioning units.</p>
<p>Aside from academia and work, Ryan enjoys cooking, fishing, camping and staying active.</p>
