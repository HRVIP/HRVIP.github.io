<h2 class="team-title">Roberto Hurtado</h2>
<h4 class="team-position"></h4>
<p>I am a fourth year double majoring in mechanical and aerospace engineering, interested in the exploration of outer space. I want to help develop the necessary technologies that will enable humans to go back to the moon, and beyond. I am currently the systems engineer for the space and satellite systems club on campus, where I help facilitate subsystem integration and perform risk analysis in order to quantify and mitigate risk. I was also the project lead in the development of a long flight UAS for air quality monitoring in the Cyber-Human-Physical Systems Lab. Aside from my engineering work, I enjoy hiking and backpacking, as well as making a great cup of coffee.</p>
